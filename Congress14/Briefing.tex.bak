\section{Venue}

All matches will be played in Penweddig School.
Simple refreshments will be available, but please keep them away from
the playing area.

The closest pubs (there are two) are in Llanbadarn, less than a mile
eastward along the A44.

Morrisons supermarket is about a mile away --- go east on the A44 and
turn right on the A4120 toward Southgate and Aberteifi.  There is also
a petrol station here.

Aberystwyth town with many pubs, cafes and restaurants is about 1
mile west along the A44 -- the persistent can usually find somewhere to
park.

\section{Problems and queries}

The Congress Secretary is Roger Boyle, who will be available
throughout.
Telephone 0771 5049478 at any reasonable time.

We hope you enjoy the Congress, and plan to return next year.
