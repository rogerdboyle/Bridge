\opening{Dear Ms Thomas,}

{\bf Aberystwyth Congress, August 15th-17th}

For 41 years, Aberystywyth Bridge Club has been holding an annual 3 day
summer congress.  You may or may not be aware that the primary competition is
titled the `Cambrian News Trophy'.

We are guessing that at its inception this was an arrangement with your
newspaper, but unsurprisingly, memories are uncertain (perhaps your
own records will tell).

We are disinclined to change the name of the Trophy, so your name will
continue to attach to the event (unless you object).  We do wonder,
though, whether some modest sponsorship may possibly be forthcoming!

The Congress is a recognised WBU event and its trophies contribute to
the [internationally recognised]
rankings of attending players.  The field is normally led by some
of the Welsh and other Internationals who regularly attend and within
the context of the game may be considered to be high profile.

I am hoping this request can get a favourable hearing -- do let me
know if I can provide you with any further details of the Congress,
Club or related affairs.

\closing{Yours sincerely,}
