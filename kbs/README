*** Name change ***

This software suite is now called "Knave Bridge Scorer".
It was previously called "Kippington Bridge Scorer"

In 2007, after a break of about 20 years, I started playing duplicate
bridge again. The local club (Kippington) that I joined used a manual system
to do the scoring. I looked at the various commercial/free programs available
at the time and decided to write my own and here it is.

It has the following 'features':

match point pairs scoring;
Neuberg calculation for missing pairs;
collection of common movements;
movement designer;
results generated in html, plain text, BridgeWebs, and Ecats' formats;
option to send result email to session players;
automatic upload to BridgeWebs site of results and competition/rankings pages;
easy to use, mouse or keyboard shortcuts to select players;
remembers  players' last partner;
pbn editor, curtain card printing for EBU format curtain cards.

It has the following missing features that you commonly see in other
available duplicate bridge scoring software suites:

No teams, multi-session, Swiss, Imp, Butler or individual scoring
methods (Our club doesn't hold such events);
No BridgeMate/BridgePad support. (Our club doesn't use such devices
although the club did experiment with using Palm devices for table
top result entry and that support still exists)

On a Windows system the installer provides a all-in-one binary, kbsone.exe,
that contains a perl runtime, modules and scoring code. The source
code is also provided and can be run only after a perl runtime
and supporting modules have been installed separately.
For Windows I recommend the 'Strawberry Perl' runtime distribution. The
kbs installer comes with a script (checkAS.pl) that will try
to install any missing modules for you and this will only work
with Strawberry Perl.

On Unix/Linux systems you will have to install any missing CPAN
modules yourself.

The files here are:

kbs.pdf    - documentation
kbs.exe    - a windows installer
badger.zip - unzip this for other OSes
knavetimer.exe - a simple bridge timer
ktimer.pdf - documentation for the bridge timer.

These are from revision 760 of the repository.

Please read the artistic license in the file "artistic_license.txt".

====================================================================
Changes for 760 release:

The pairs ordering in the Pairmap entry section is by table number,
so you no longer have to cycle through the table slips twice.

Fixed warning generated by leaving out the lead when running the
score process.

Fixed issue with comp.pl not ignoring '_' score files.

Dropped EBU format support - I'm never going to use it.
====================================================================

Changes for 784 release.

Moved most of the code from the programs into the library, so
that everything can be called from kbs.pl. Build and provide a kbsone.exe
binary that contains the perl and Tk runtime, so you can run the code
without installing perl. Update the doc.
====================================================================

Changes for 801 release
Change the name from Kipp points to Wilsons. Make the session setup
program part of all-in-one. Allow movegen to be run from the all-in-one
by invoking the command: ../kbsone --command movegen [movegen args]
Run inactive every time 'score' is clicked.
Add ecats box. If set the ecats program will be run to produce the
ecats score files. 
====================================================================

Changes for 858 release
Added partial support for Bridgemate devices. I don't have access
to Bridgemate hardware, so the code has only been tested using Jeff
Smith's BMTest program. The launching of BM controller software
will certainly need to be changed. 

Most importantly, this release has been built with the
latest PAR::Packer, kbsone.exe should now actually work 
on perl free machines.
I've only recently had access to a spare machine without a
perl runtime installed, so I've only just spotted this error.
My apologies to those who have downloaded the code, only to
find that double clicking on the program icon does nothing.
I would appreciate feedback on any errors that you find, my
email address is listed below. (It would also be helpful if
someone could check to see if this works on an Apple machine,
with a list of the extra modules that need to be installed).

Changes how kbsone launches the standalone scripts. rather than
typing ../kbsone --command inactive, leave out the "--command".
The builtin standalone supported scripts are:

inactive - marks inactive players in the contact.csv file.
movegen - shows movement details
bsetup - run the setup script to set the tables, movement and pairs
score - score a session
comp - generate the competition files
mailer - mail the results to the session players
uploadbw - upload the competition files to the Bridgewebs site
uploadresult - uploasd the result to the Bridgewebs site.

A new sessions button. You can now select a previous session from
a list of all the known sessions, rather than selecting by its date.
If the session has not been scored yet, you can remove the setup file.
This lets you reselect the session setup details.

Fix to the score routine, to reset the pair's points.

The pair lookup routine will now accept an unknown pair number.
====================================================================

Changes for 913 release:

- remove Bridgemate support from release. This makes the release much smaller. Anyone
that wants to try Bridgemate support will have to use the svn repo.

- New T6R9 movement file. (Reduced 6 table Howell)

- New competition page (howyou.htm) to generate a plot of player percentage against session.

- Use CSS to layout the movement html output.

- New competition page (graph.htm) to plot average monthly session numbers over the years.

- Tidy up descriptive text in most of the movement files.

- Make the analysis competition page use a namespace.

- Add option to stop master points being displayed in the output.

- Add option to generate a suffix for the output compettion pages. This makes
it easy to go back and generate a club's historical records, see http://www.bridgewebs.com/stjulians
in the "Result Statistics" menu item.

- Change the rank names in the decay competition page. Use a heuristic to detemine the
rank ranges.

- Correct the T8DWR8 movement so the table movement cards print nicely.

- Correct many svn keywords.

- Add configuratuon option to control how points decay.

====================================================================

Changes for the 964 release:

- add the scorebridge to kbs converter to the release.

- colour changes in the leading player html page.

- remove inactive players from the leading players page.

- Add the table movement card generator, along with instructions. (Only
in the zip file)

- bridge timer work, provide a separate downloadable file.
